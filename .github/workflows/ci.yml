  ## Setup Instructions

  1. Replace all instances of `py-perf` and `py_perf` with your actual library name
  2. Update author information in `pyproject.toml` and `__init__.py`
  3. Update the GitHub URLs in `pyproject.toml`
  4. Customize the description and functionality in the core module

  ## Building and Publishing

  ```bash
  # Build the package
  python -m build

# Upload to PyPI (requires twine and PyPI account)
pip install twine
twine upload dist/*
